This was not meant to be a game, it had no initial design, it is more like a bunch of Unity 3D tests that came up this way. Due to his testing nature, the code is 99% uncommented and is a complete mess.

But since I worked on it more or less 25-30 hours and it can be played like regular game, I'm releasing it as a full open source game (see LICENSE.TXT for details).
It's my first "non jam" released game and the first game released as A.C.id Videogames
